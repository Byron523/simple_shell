# SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT

this is a simple shell project, which mimics the basics of the linux terminal shell cmd line
-> the Shell is written in C programming language

# To run the shell on your PC

-> You need at least Ubuntu 20.04
-> CLone the repo to your local machine

-> to compile run: '''gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh '''
-> to run the code: ./hsh
## Basic Functionality

-> Main.c is the entry point to the shell
-> while_loop.c is the function that runs commands entered through the terminal not using pipes
-> execve.c is the program that finally executes the cmd given by the user
## License

No License for the shell
